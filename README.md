# Hi there, I'm Jessica 👋

## 🤔 About Me
I'm currently a Sofware Engineer at Dell Technologies, working in embedded/firmware engineering. I joined 2+ years ago and have worked across BIOS, Embedded Controller and Root Cause Analysis teams.

I got my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering in May 2023 from Stony Brook University with honors and a spot on the Dean's List.

I love working on embedded design projects (Arduino, ESP32, C programming) but I also like exploring almost everything else: websites (Python, React), apps (Android, Apple), AI/ML, blockchain, etc.

When I'm not engineering, I spend my time doing hot yoga, dance classes, tennis, reading, journalling, watching Tiktoks, etc
  
## 🚀 Projects I've worked on recently
- [Horizen](https://github.com/jessicauv/fashion_supply_chain): Horizen is a blockchain-based platform that tracks fashion supply chains, ensuring transparency, fairness, and real-time data. Our Chrome extension alerts users when they view a product with a low ethical score, encouraging responsible shopping.
- [Tiktokify My Notes](https://github.com/jessicauv/tiktokify-my-notes): Tiktok My Notes transforms student notes into audios inspired by Tiktok videos.
